# Ocean Park Tides Bot
This is a collection of simple Python scripts and Systemd timers/services which work together to send daily updates on the tides in Ocean Park Maine to a Telegram chat.

## Installation
To install, run the `install.sh` script with root privileges. The script copies service files to `/etc/systemd/system` so you can update the installation by re-running the install script.
